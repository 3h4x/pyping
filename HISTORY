Revision history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

September 12, 2011
--------------
Bugfixes + cleanup by Jens Diemer
Tested with Ubuntu + Windows 7

September 6, 2011
--------------
Cleanup by Martin Falatic. Restored lost comments and docs. Improved
functionality: constant time between pings, internal times consistently
use milliseconds. Clarified annotations (e.g., in the checksum routine).
Using unsigned data in IP & ICMP header pack/unpack unless otherwise
necessary. Signal handling. Ping-style output formatting and stats.

August 3, 2011
--------------
Ported to py3k by Zach Ware. Mostly done by 2to3; also minor changes to
deal with bytes vs. string changes (no more ord() in checksum() because
>source_string< is actually bytes, added .encode() to data in
send_one_ping()).  That's about it.

March 11, 2010
--------------
changes by Samuel Stauffer:
- replaced time.clock with default_timer which is set to
  time.clock on windows and time.time on other systems.

November 8, 2009
----------------
Improved compatibility with GNU/Linux systems.

Fixes by:
 * George Notaras -- http://www.g-loaded.eu
Reported by:
 * Chris Hallman -- http://cdhallman.blogspot.com

Changes in this release:
 - Re-use time.time() instead of time.clock(). The 2007 implementation
   worked only under Microsoft Windows. Failed on GNU/Linux.
   time.clock() behaves differently under the two OSes[1].

May 30, 2007
------------
little rewrite by Jens Diemer:
 -  change socket asterisk import to a normal import
 -  replace time.time() with time.clock()
 -  delete "return None" (or change to "return" only)
 -  in checksum() rename "str" to "source_string"

December 4, 2000
----------------
Changed the struct.pack() calls to pack the checksum and ID as
unsigned. My thanks to Jerome Poincheval for the fix.

November 22, 1997
-----------------
Initial hack. Doesn't do much, but rather than try to guess
what features I (or others) will want in the future, I've only
put in what I need now.

December 16, 1997
-----------------
For some reason, the checksum bytes are in the wrong order when
this is run under Solaris 2.X for SPARC but it works right under
Linux x86. Since I don't know just what's wrong, I'll swap the
bytes always and then do an htons().
